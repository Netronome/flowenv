/**
 * This file contains the API for accessing BLM-managed freelists of
 * MU buffers.  A client would typically use blm_buf_alloc() to allocate
 * an MU buffer and blm_buf_free() to release it.  The _bulk() variants
 * allow the user to allocate and free buffers in batches.  These APIs
 * do not maintain any local state in the client microengine and do
 * not require any explicit initialization.

 * For optimization reasons the following assumptions are made:
